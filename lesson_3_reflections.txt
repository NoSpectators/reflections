When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--shared work! also redundant storage!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--sometimes we are simply not ready to update everything. there are 
numerous scenarious where we would not want to have the remote repository updated.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-forks are used to clone another repository only on Github!
-clones are used to clone another repository from Github to my local
machine.
-branches are used to introduce a new feature in a project on my machine
