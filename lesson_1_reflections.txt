I learned that I like Git Bash, and I can use notepad with it, but
I cannot use notepad++ or Sublime. This is going to be interesting. Boom.

I think it's cool that you can look up previous versions on Googledocs by 
going to the top of the browser and clicking on "..made last edit" and 
then it shows the previous versions! 

There are many different ways to conduct version control; some of them
are not helpful to programmers, but at least there are ways to 
save files (iteratively). 

I've just learned how to determine when / how often to git commit. It seems like
it's important for logical errors to have their own commit. It also seems like there 
is a common sense way not "over-commit" or "under-commit". 

I think Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because it's more of an 
automated/scaled task. Google docs, although helpful, is not meant for this task.

One thing I liked about using Git so far was being able to use Git log and also
see how many changes were done per file. 

So, I figured out how to see which commit had the error by using git diff. It was cool.

How do I want to use git? I want to start using it for my own work as 
an individual student. I think that would be great.
