What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--It creates a hidden folder in the directory called .git where the 
git logs are kept for all changes to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
--The staging area is a "DMZ"; it's sort of in-between the working
directory and the repository. It allows a programmer to add one/some 
of the files to the repository instead of committing all the files at
once (the goal is to add a file to the repository every logical change).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
--Once I make a change in the working directory, I do a git status, and notice a file has been modified. Then I use git add to put it in the staging area. Then I use git diff to compare the status of working directory and staging area, and git diff --staged to check status of staging area compared to repository. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
--this idea of branching is really cool. I can see it being very helpful when new ideas (different from a small syntactical change) to code would be introduced. cool. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
-diagrams help visualize the branch structure by showing the parents and children of the commits. That way I can see what is accessible through git log and potentially how I can lose a commit. This is worth going over a few times. 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
--the result was that two branches were merged, and their commits in git log will be merged, though not with the parents of the commit; rather by the timestamp. 

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
-the cons are that you have to do the manual work; the pros are that Git makes the developer figure it out and doesn't merge things it shouldn't. this is great.
